## Introduction:
- stands for hypertext preprocessor
- php is a widely-used, open source scription language
- executed on the server
- free to download and use
- php files can contain text, html, css, js, and php code
- php files are returned to browser as plain html.
- ext: .php, .php3, or .phtml

### features:
- can generate dynamic page content
- can do create, read, open, write, delete, and close files on server
- can collect form data
- can send and recieve cookies
- and add, delete, modify data in your db
- used to control user-access
- can encrypt data

- runs on various platforms (win, linux, unix, mac, etc)
- compatible with almost all servers used today(apache, iis, etc)
- supports a wide range of db
- www.php.net
- easy to learn and runs efficiently on the server side

---

## Installing and Configuring PHP and MYSQL
- install a web server (WAMP, XAMP, IIS, etc.)
- install php
- install a db, eg. MySQL

### basic syntax
- php scripting block always starts with \<? and ends with ?>.
- can be placed anywhere on the document.
- syntax:
    - \<?php
    - ...
    - ?>
- php file normally contains html tags, like html file, and some php scripting code.
- php statements end with semicolon

#### comments
- single line using:
    - //
    - \#
- multiline/block using:
    - /* ... */

#### case sensitivity
- all keywords are not case-sensitive

---

## Variables
- a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name
- eg:

    ```php
    <?php
      $txt="hellow world.";
      $x=5;
      $y=10;
      echo $txt;
      echo "<br>";
      echo $x;
      echo "<br>";
      echo $y;
    ?>
    ```

- variable can have short name like x or y or a more descriptive name
- rules:
    1. start with $ sing, followed by name
    2. must start with a letter or underscore
    3. cannot start with a number
    4. can only contain alpha-numberic chars and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)
    5. are case sensitive
    

---

## Basic Data Types
- loosely typed lang
- do not have to tell which dt the var is
- automatically converts the var to the correct dt, depending on its value
- scope:
    - local
    - global
    - static

### Scope
#### global and local
- var declared outside a function has global scope and can only be accessed outside a function
- eg:

    ```php
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <body>
     <?php
     $x = 5; // global scope
     function myTest() {
     // using x inside this function will generate an error
     echo "<p>Variable x inside function is: $x</p>"; //no value will be printed
     }
     myTest();
     echo "<p>Variable x outside function is: $x</p>"; //print 5
     ?>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

- a var declared within a func has a local scope and can only be accessed within that func
- eg:

    ```php
    <?php
    function myTest() {
    $x = 5; // local scope
    echo "<p>Variable x inside function is: $x</p>";
    }
    myTest(); //print 5
    // using x outside the function will generate an error
    echo "<p>Variable x outside function is: $x</p>";
    ?>
    ```

- global keyword is used to access ablobal variable form within a function.
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
    $x = 5;
    $y = 10;
    function myTest() {
        global $x, $y;
        $y = $x + $y;
    }
    myTest();
    echo $y; // outputs 15
    ?>
    ```

- php also stores all global vars in an array called $GLOBALS[index]
- index holds the name of variable.
- this array is also accessible from within fuctions and can be used to update global variables directly.
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
    $x = 5;
    $y = 10;
    function myTest() {
        $GLOBALS['y'] = $GLOBALS['x'] + $GLOBALS['y'];
    }
    myTest();
    echo $y; // outputs 15
    ?>
    ```

#### static
- normally when a fuc is completed/exec, all of its vars are deleted. However sometimes we want a local variable not to be deleted.
- each time the func is called, static var will still have the info it contained from the last time the func was called.
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
    function myTest() {
        static $x = 0;
        echo $x;
        $x++
    }
    myTest();
    echo "<br>"
    myTest();
    echo "<br>"
    myTest();
    ?>
    ```

#### output statements
- 2 way:
    1. echo
    2. print
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
    print "<h2>PHP is fun.</h2>";
    print "hellow world"<br>";
    print "i'm learning php.";
    ?>
    ```

- diff bw the 2:
    - echo has no return val while print has a ret val of 1 so it can be used in exps.
    - echo can take multiple parameters while print can take one arg.
    - echo is faster than print
    - eg:
        ```php
        <?php
        $x= print(“hello”); //return 1
        echo “hello”, “Bye”; //multiple parameter
        print "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";
        echo "Hello world!<br>";
        print "I'm about to learn PHP!";
        ?>
        ```

### data types:
- var can store data of diff types:
    1. string
    2. integer
    3. float
    4. boolean
    5. array
    6. object
    7. NULL

#### string
- sequence of chars, like "hello world".
- can be any text inside quotes. 
- can use both single and double quotes
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
    $x = "Hello world!";
    $y = 'Hello world!';p
    echo $x;
    echo "<br>";
    echo $y;
    ?>
    ```

#### integer
- An integer is a whole number (without decimals). 
- It is a number between -2,147,483,648 and +2,147,483,647. i.e. 4 bytes
- Rules for integers:
    - An integer must have at least one digit (0-9)
    - An integer cannot contain comma or blanks
    - An integer must not have a decimal point
    - An integer can be either positive or negative
    - Integers can be specified in three formats: decimal (10- based), hexadecimal (16-based - prefixed with 0x) or octal (8-based - prefixed with 0)
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
        $x = 5985;
        var_dump($x);
    ?>
    Result: int(5985)
    ```

#### float
- number with a decimal point or a number in exp form
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
        $x = 10.544;
        var_dump($x);
    ?>
    ```

#### boolean
- represent two possible states: TRUE or FALSE.
- often used in cond testing
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
        $x = true;
        $y = false;
        var_dump($x);
        var_dump($y);
    ?>
    ```

#### array
- stores mulitple vals in one single var.
- eg:
    ```php
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    <?php
    $cars = array("Volvo","BMW","Toyota");
    var_dump($cars);
    ?>
    </body>
    </html>
    Result: array(3) { [0]=> string(5) "Volvo" [1]=> string(3) "BMW" [2]=> string(6) "Toyota" }
    ```

#### object
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
        $x = 10.544;
        var_dump($x);
    ?>
    ```

#### NULL
- special data type which can have only ohe val: NULL
- var of dt NULL is a var that has no value assigned to it
- var created without a val, is automatically assigned a val of NULL
- vars can also be emptied by setting value to NULL
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
        $x = 10.544;
        $x = null;
        var_dump($x);
    ?>
    ```

---

## Operators
- used to perform operation on vars and values.
- types:
    1. Arithmetic operators
        ```
        +, -, *, /, %, **
        ```
    2. Assignment operators
        ```
        =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
        ```
    3. Comparison operators
        ```
        ==, ===, !=, <>, !==, >, <, >=, <=,
        ```
    4. Increment/Decrement operators
        ```
        ++$, $++, --$, $--
        ```
    5. Logical operators
        ```
        and, or, xor, &&, ||, !
        ```
    6. String operators
        ```
        . (concatenation), .=
        ```
    7. Array operators  
        ```
        +, ==, ===, !=, <>, !==
        ```

---

## Constants
- its an identifier for a simple value. 
- value cannot be changed during the script
- valid names: starts with letter or underscore
- no $ sign before the constatn name.
- to create a constant use the define() function
- eg: define(name, value, case-insensitive)
- parameters:
    - name: name for the const
    - value: value for the const
    - case-insensitive: specifies whether the const name should be case-insensitive. Default is false
    - ex:
        ```php
        <?php
        define("GREETING", "Welcome to the party", true);
        echo GREETING;
        ?>
        ```
### global nature
- constants are automatically global and can be used across the entire script.

---

## Array
- indexed array
    - array with numeric index
- associative array
    - arrays with named keys
- multidimensional arrays
    - arrays containing one or more arrays

### Indexed arrays
- There are two ways to create indexed arrays:
    1. $cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");
        - Here, index can be assigned automatically (index always starts at 0)
    2. Index can be assigned manually
    - $cars[0] = "Volvo";
        - $cars[1] = "BMW";
        - $cars[2] = "Toyota";
- access array elements using index
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
    $cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");
    $arrlength = count($cars);
    for($x = 0; $x < $arrlength; $x++) {
        echo $cars[$x];
        echo "<br>";
    }
    ?>
    ```

### Associative arrays
- Associative arrays are arrays that use named keys that you assign to them.
- There are two ways to create an associative array:
    1. using array() func:
        - $age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");
    2. using indexing:
        - $age['Peter'] = "35";
        - $age['Ben'] = "37";
        - $age['Joe'] = "43";
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
    $age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");
    foreach($age as $x => $x_value) {
        echo "Key=" . $x . ", Value=" . $x_value;
        echo "<br>";
    }
    ?>
    ```

### Multidimensional arrays
- array containing one or more arrays
- 2-dim arrays:
    - array of arrays
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
    $cars = array
    (
        array("Volvo",22,18),
        array("BMW",15,13),
        array("Saab",5,2),
        array("Land Rover",17,15)
    );
    ?>
    ```

---

## Looping with Associative Array using each() and foreach()
### loops
- while- loops through a block of code as long as the specified cond is ture
- do...while- loops through the block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the cond is true
- for- loops though a block of code a specified number of times
- foreach- loops through a block of code for each element in an array
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
    $x = 1;
    while($x <= 5) {
        echo "The number is: $x <br>";
        $x++;
    }

    do {
        // code block
    } while (cond);

    for ($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++) {
        //body
    }

    foreach ($array as $value) {
        //code
    }

    ?>
    ```

## Strings Processing

---

## Form Processing

---

## Connecting to Database
- mysql_connect() function
- syntax: mysql_connect(servername, username, password);
- eg:
    ```php
    <?php
    $con = mysql_connect("localhost", "peter", "abc123");
    if(!$con) {
        die("could not connet: " . mysql_error());
    }
    // some code
    ?>
    ```

- closing conneciton:
    - mysql_close($con);

- query mysql from php
    - function: mysql_query()
    - eg:
        ```php
        <?php
        $con = mysql_connect("localhost", "peter", "abc123");
        if(!$con) {
            die("could not connet: " . mysql_error());
        }
        if(mysql_query("CREATE DATABASE my_db", $con)) {
            echo "db created";
        } else {
            echo "error creating db: " . mysql_error();
        }
        mysql_close($con);
        ?>
        ```
- create table:
    - eg:
        ```php
        <?php
        $con = mysql_connect("localhost", "peter", "abc123");
        if(!$con) {
            die("could not connet: " . mysql_error());
        }

        if(mysql_query("CREATE DATABASE my_db", $con)) {
            echo "db created";
        } else {
            echo "error creating db: " . mysql_error();
        }

        mysql_select_db("my_db", $con);
        $sql = "CREATE TABLE Persons (
                                personID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
                                PRIMARY KEY(personID),
                                FirstName varchar(15),
                                LastName varchar(15),
                                Age int
                                )";
        // Execute query
        mysql_query($sql, $con);
        mysql_close($con);
        ?>
        ```

---

## Performing Basic Database operations (Insert , Update , Delete , Select etc.)
- insert into table:
    - eg:
        ```php
        <?php
        // create connection 
        // select table

        $sql = "INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName, LastName, Age)
                    VALUES ('peter', 'griffin', '35')";
        // Execute query
        mysql_query($sql, $con);
        mysql_close($con);
        ?>
        ```

- select:
    - eg:
        ```php
        <?php
        // create connection 
        // select table

        $sql = "SELECT * FROM Persons";
        // Execute query
        $result = mysql_query($sql, $con);

        while($row == mysql_fetch_array($result)) {
            echo $row['FirstName'] . " " . $row['LastName'];
            echo "<br />";
        }

        mysql_close($con);
        ?>
        ```
    - use mysql_fetch_array() func to return the first row from the recordset as an array.
    - each call to mysql_fetch_array() returns the next row in the recordset.

- update:
    - syntax: update table_name set column1=val, column2=val, ... Where some_col = some_val
- delete:
    - to delete records
        - delete from table_name where some_col = some_val

## Setting Query parameter

---

## Executing Query Join ( Self Join, Inner Join, Outer Join, Cross Join )

---

## Cookies
- Cookie is a small piece of information which is stored at client browser. It is used to recognize the user.
- Cookie is created at server side and saved to client browser.
- Each time when client sends request to the server, cookie is embedded with request. This way, cookie can be received at the server side

---

## Create Session
- start session:
    - eg: 
        ```php 
        <?php 
        session_start(); 
        ?> 
        <html>
        ..
        ```
- storing a session var:
    - eg: 
        ```php 
        <?php 
        session_start(); 
        $_SESSION['views'] = 1;
        ?> 
        <html>
        ..
        ```

- destroying a session:
    - eg: 
        ```php
        <?php 
        session_start(); 
        $_SESSION['views'] = 1;
        unset($_SESSION['views']);
        ?> 
        <html>
        ...
        // html code
        <?php
        session_destroy();
        ?>
        ```
