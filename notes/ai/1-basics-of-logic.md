# basics of logic

## introduction
goals:
- represent knowledge
- reason with that knowledge

logic is arguably the most important approach to knowledge representation

logic (almost by definition):
- has a well defined syntax and sematics
- concerned with truth preserving inferrence

logic studies ways in which human reason formally through arguments.

'Logic' usually reffers to *propositional logic* or *first-order predicate logic*.

### Logical Argument
a finite set of statements consisting of premise(i.e. facts, knowledge and supporting evidence) ,and conclusion.

puts reasoning into words

conclusion is identified by a (therefore symbol)

for eg:
- if you overslept, you'll be late
- you are not late
- therefore you didn't oversleep.

## Syllogistic Logic
invinted by aristotle

syllogistic language:
- capital letters for general categories
- lowercase letter for specific items/individuals

ex:
- knowledge:
  - all logicians are smart.
  - urbanowicz is a logician.
  - tf urbanowicz is smart
- syllogistic rep:
  - all L are S
  - u is L
  - tf u is S

### Well-formed formulas (wffs):
- syntax (acceptable objects) of logic
- use 5 words: all, no, some, is, not
- Wffs have any of these 8 forms:
  1. all A is B
  2. some A is B
  3. x is A
  4. x is y
  5. no A is B
  6. some A is not B
  7. x is not A
  8. x is not y


**Wffs with venn diagrams:**
- venn diag: diag. consisting of various overlapping figures contained in a rect. called the universe (U)
- all A is B: complete overalap
- no A is B: no overalap
- some A is B: partial overalap

**syllogism:**
- arguments of 2 or more wffs in which each letter occurs twice and the letters "form a chain"
  - each wff has at least one letter in commen with the wff just below it, and first wff has at least one letter in common with the last wff

**Enthymeme:**
- argument in which the major premise is left unstated
  - often a conclusion supported by a single premise
