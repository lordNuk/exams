# IP Security
- a suit of protocols used to secure ip communication by providing encryption authentication and integrity at the network layer.
- it's  designed to protect data transmitted over IP networks, ensuring confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of the data packets.

- components:
    1. authentication header
        - provides data inte., auth, and anti-reply protection
        - protects teh ip packet header and selected parts of the packet from modificaiton
        - doesn't encrypt the payload, only provides integrity and authentication.
    2. encapsulation security payload(ESP)
        - offers confidentiality, int, and auth for packet's payload
        - encrypts the packet payload to ensure confi.
        - can be used in comb. with AH for comprehensive security.


## **IP Security:**

### **Overview:**
- **Definition:** IP Security (IPsec) is a suite of protocols that ensure secure communication over Internet Protocol (IP) networks.
  
- **Objectives:**
  1. **Confidentiality:** Protecting data from unauthorized access.
  2. **Integrity:** Ensuring data is not tampered with during transmission.
  3. **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of communicating parties.
  4. **Anti-Replay:** Preventing replay attacks by verifying the freshness of packets.

### **Architecture:**
- **Components:**
  1. **Security Associations (SA):** Defines parameters for secure communication.
  2. **Security Parameters Index (SPI):** Identifies the SA in use.
  3. **Security Policy Database (SPD):** Stores security policies.
  4. **Security Association Database (SAD):** Maintains active SAs.

### **IPsec Protocols:**
1. **Authentication Header (AH):**
   - **Purpose:** Provides connectionless integrity and data origin authentication for IP packets.
   - **Components:** Hashed MAC, Sequence number, IP header fields.

2. **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP):**
   - **Purpose:** Provides confidentiality, data integrity, and optional authentication for IP packets.
   - **Components:** Payload encryption, authentication data.

3. **Combining Security Associations:**
   - **Purpose:** Combines multiple security associations to provide a higher level of security.

4. **Internet Key Exchange (IKE):**
   - **Purpose:** Facilitates the negotiation and exchange of keys for secure communication.
   - **Phases:** IKE operates in two phases: Phase 1 for establishing a secure channel, Phase 2 for setting up SAs.

## **Web Security:**

### **Web Security Considerations:**
- **Threats:**
  1. **Injection Attacks:** Exploiting vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code.
  2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting scripts into web pages viewed by others.
  3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Forcing users to perform unintended actions.
  
- **Security Measures:**
  1. **Input Validation:** Ensure input data is safe and within expected parameters.
  2. **HTTPS:** Encrypts data in transit using SSL/TLS.
  3. **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Controls resource loading to mitigate XSS.

### **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS):**
- **SSL:**
  - **Purpose:** Provides secure communication over a computer network.
  - **Components:** Handshake protocol, Record protocol, Alert protocol.

- **TLS:**
  - **Evolution:** TLS is the successor to SSL, providing improved security and performance.
  - **Versions:** TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and later versions.

### **Electronic Payment:**
- **Security Challenges:**
  1. **Data Privacy:** Protecting sensitive payment information.
  2. **Transaction Integrity:** Ensuring the integrity of payment transactions.
  3. **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of parties involved.

- **Security Measures:**
  1. **Tokenization:** Replaces sensitive data with a unique identifier (token).
  2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Requires users to provide two forms of identification.

## **Intrusion Detection Systems and Firewalls:**

### **Intruders and Intrusion Detection:**
- **Intruders:**
  1. **Hackers:** Individuals who gain unauthorized access to systems.
  2. **Crackers:** Individuals who break software security.

- **Intrusion Detection:**
  - **Purpose:** Identify and respond to malicious activities.
  - **Types:** Signature-based, Anomaly-based, Behavior-based.

### **Password Management:**
- **Importance:**
  1. **User Authentication:** Passwords are a common form of user authentication.
  2. **Data Protection:** Weak passwords can lead to unauthorized access.

- **Best Practices:**
  1. **Password Complexity:** Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
  2. **Password Encryption:** Store passwords securely using encryption techniques.

### **Firewalls:**

#### **Need:**
- **Protection:**
  - **Internal Networks:** Shield internal networks from external threats.
  - **Sensitive Data:** Safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access.

#### **Characteristics:**
- **Packet Filtering:** Examines packets and permits or denies based on predefined rules.
- **Stateful Inspection:** Keeps track of the state of active connections.
- **Proxying:** Acts as an intermediary between internal and external networks.

#### **Types of Firewalls:**
1. **Packet Filtering Firewalls:**
   - **Operation:** Examines packets and allows or blocks based on predefined rules.
   - **Strengths:** Simple, efficient, and transparent.

2. **Stateful Inspection Firewalls:**
   - **Operation:** Monitors the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context.
   - **Strengths:** Enhanced security through understanding the context of traffic.

#### **Placement of Firewalls:**
- **Network Perimeter:** At the boundary between an internal and external network.
- **Internal Segments:** Within the internal network to segment different sections.

#### **Firewall Configuration:**
- **Rule-Based Configuration:**
  1. **Default Deny:** Blocks all traffic by default, allowing only explicitly permitted traffic.
  2. **Default Allow:** Permits all traffic by default, blocking only explicitly denied traffic.

### **Trusted Systems:**
- **Definition:** Trusted systems are secure computing systems with mechanisms to ensure security and integrity.
  
- **Components:**
  1. **Trusted Computing Base (TCB):** Core components responsible for security.
  2. **Reference Monitor:** Enforces security policies.

- **Assurance Levels:**
  1. **Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL):** Ranks the security assurance of a system.
  2. **Common Criteria:** Standard for evaluating and certifying the security of IT products.
