# **UNIT II: Secret Key and Public Key Cryptography**

## **Secret Key Cryptography**

### **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**

#### **Overview:**
- **Definition:**
  - DES is a symmetric-key block cipher that was adopted as a federal standard in the 1970s.
- **Key Features:**
  1. *Block Size:* Operates on 64-bit blocks of data.
  2. *Key Size:* Uses a 56-bit key (though the effective key size is 56 bits due to parity bits).

#### **Strength of DES:**
1. **Feistel Structure:**
   - DES uses a Feistel network, providing a high degree of confusion and diffusion.
2. **Key Size:**
   - While the 56-bit key size is considered small by modern standards, DES was designed in an era when computational resources were limited.

#### **Block Cipher, Design Principles, and Modes of Operations:**

##### **Block Cipher:**
- **Definition:**
  - A block cipher processes data in fixed-size blocks during encryption and decryption.
- **DES Block Cipher Operation:**
  1. *Substitution (S-boxes):* Each 6-bit block of the plaintext is substituted with a 4-bit block.
  2. *Permutation (P-boxes):* Rearranges the bits.

##### **Design Principles:**
1. **Confusion:**
   - Confusion is achieved through the use of substitution boxes (S-boxes).
2. **Diffusion:**
   - Diffusion is achieved through permutation boxes (P-boxes) and the iterative nature of the Feistel structure.

##### **Modes of Operation:**
- DES can be used in various modes to provide confidentiality and integrity for data larger than a single block.
  1. **Electronic Codebook (ECB):**
     - Each block is independently encrypted.
  2. **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):**
     - Each block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption.
  3. **Cipher Feedback (CFB) and Output Feedback (OFB):**
     - Turn block ciphers into stream ciphers.

### **Triple DES (3DES)**

#### **Overview:**
- **Definition:**
  - Triple DES is a symmetric-key block cipher that applies DES three times to each data block.
- **Keying Options:**
  1. *Two-Key 3DES:* Key1 encrypts, Key2 decrypts, Key1 encrypts.
  2. *Three-Key 3DES:* Each key is used for one encryption operation.

#### **Strengths:**
- 3DES provides increased key length and security compared to single DES.
- It remains secure even if one or two keys are compromised.

## **Public Key Cryptography**

### **Principles of Public Key Cryptosystems**

#### **Overview:**
- **Definition:**
  - Public key cryptography uses a pair of keys: a public key that is widely shared and a private key kept secret.
- **Principles:**
  1. *Public Key:* Used for encryption and known to everyone.
  2. *Private Key:* Used for decryption and kept secret.

#### **Key Exchange Problem:**
- Traditional symmetric key cryptography faces the key exchange problem: how to securely distribute keys between communicating parties.

### **RSA Algorithm**

#### **Overview:**
- **Definition:**
  - RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely used public key algorithm for secure data transmission.
- **Key Generation:**
  1. *Key Pair Generation:* Select two large prime numbers, p and q.
  2. *Compute n:* n = p * q.
  3. *Compute ϕ(n):* ϕ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1).
  4. *Select e:* Choose e such that 1 < e < ϕ(n) and e is coprime to ϕ(n).
  5. *Compute d:* Find d such that (d * e) % ϕ(n) = 1.
- **Encryption and Decryption:**
  - **Encryption:** \(C \equiv M^e \mod n\)
  - **Decryption:** \(M \equiv C^d \mod n\)

### **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm**

#### **Overview:**
- **Definition:**
  - Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange algorithm allowing two parties to securely agree on a shared secret over an insecure communication channel.
- **Process:**
  1. *Public Parameters:* Agree on public parameters \(p\) (a prime) and \(g\) (a primitive root modulo \(p\)).
  2. *Private Keys:* Each party selects a private key (\(a\) and \(b\)).
  3. *Public Keys:* Compute public keys \(A = g^a \mod p\) and \(B = g^b \mod p\).
  4. *Shared Secret:* Compute the shared secret \(s = A^b \mod p = B^a \mod p\).
