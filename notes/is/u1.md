# **UNIT I: Introduction and Basics of Cryptography**

## **Introduction**

### **Security Attacks: Motives, Vulnerabilities, Defense Strategies, and Techniques**

#### **Motives:**
- *Definition:* Security attacks aim to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information for various motives.
- *Examples:* Financial gain, political motives, espionage, sabotage.

#### **Vulnerabilities:**
- *Definition:* Weaknesses or flaws in a system that can be exploited by attackers.
- *Examples:* Unpatched software, weak passwords, misconfigured permissions.

#### **Defense Strategies and Techniques:**
1. **Proactive Measures:**
   - *Security Policies:* Establishing rules and guidelines.
   - *Access Controls:* Restricting unauthorized access.
2. **Reactive Measures:**
   - *Incident Response:* Coordinated actions to manage and mitigate security incidents.
   - *Forensics:* Investigating and analyzing security incidents.

### **Various Attacks: DoS, DDoS, Session Hijacking, Spoofing, Phishing, Buffer Overflow, Format String Attacks, SQL Injection, Malicious Software**

#### **Denial of Service (DoS):**
- *Definition:* Overloading a system to make it unavailable to users.
- *Example:* Flooding a web server with traffic.

#### **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):**
- *Definition:* Coordinated DoS attacks from multiple sources.
- *Example:* Botnets launching simultaneous attacks.

#### **Session Hijacking:**
- *Definition:* Unauthorized interception of an active session.
- *Example:* Stealing session cookies.

#### **Spoofing:**
- *Definition:* Masquerading as someone or something else.
- *Example:* IP Spoofing to impersonate a trusted entity.

#### **Phishing:**
- *Definition:* Deceptive attempts to acquire sensitive information.
- *Example:* Fake emails posing as legitimate institutions.

#### **Buffer Overflow:**
- *Definition:* Exploiting a program's memory to overwrite adjacent data.
- *Example:* Injecting code beyond a buffer's capacity.

#### **Format String Attacks:**
- *Definition:* Exploiting vulnerabilities in how a program handles format specifiers.
- *Example:* Modifying memory based on user input.

#### **SQL Injection:**
- *Definition:* Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries.
- *Example:* Altering a query to manipulate or retrieve data.

#### **Malicious Software (Malware):**
- *Definition:* Software designed to harm or exploit systems.
- *Examples:* Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware.

### **Prevention and Detection, Data Protection, Response, Recovery, and Forensics**

#### **Prevention and Detection:**
- *Preventive Measures:* Implementing security measures to stop attacks.
- *Detective Measures:* Monitoring and identifying security incidents.

#### **Data Protection:**
- *Encryption:* Securing data by converting it into a coded format.
- *Access Controls:* Restricting access to sensitive information.

#### **Response:**
- *Incident Response Plan:* Coordinated actions to address security incidents promptly.
- *Communication:* Keeping stakeholders informed during incidents.

#### **Recovery:**
- *System Restoration:* Restoring affected systems to normal operation.
- *Data Restoration:* Recovering lost or compromised data.

#### **Forensics:**
- *Digital Forensics:* Investigating and analyzing digital evidence.
- *Legal Implications:* Ensuring the admissibility of evidence in legal proceedings.

## **Basics of Cryptography**

### **Symmetric Cipher Model**

#### **Definition:**
- Symmetric cryptography uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
- *Key Features:* Fast and efficient for large amounts of data.

### **Substitution Techniques, Transportation Techniques**

#### **Substitution Techniques:**
- *Definition:* Replacing elements of plaintext with other elements.
- *Examples:* Caesar cipher, monoalphabetic substitution, polyalphabetic substitution.

#### **Transportation Techniques:**
- *Definition:* Rearranging the order of elements in plaintext.
- *Examples:* Rail Fence cipher, columnar transposition.

### **Other Cipher Properties: Confusion, Diffusion, Block and Stream Ciphers**

#### **Confusion:**
- *Definition:* Making the relationship between the key and the ciphertext complex.
- *Example:* Substitution ciphers.

#### **Diffusion:**
- *Definition:* Spreading the influence of one plaintext bit across the ciphertext.
- *Example:* Permutation ciphers.

#### **Block and Stream Ciphers:**
- *Block Ciphers:* Operate on fixed-size blocks of data.
- *Stream Ciphers:* Encrypt data bit by bit.
